# Old_Car_price_prediction

Hello Data Science Enthisuiast, This End-End Project is about ,as mentioned in repository name , Its About Old Car Price Prediction
Nowadays We can see that people are more searching for second hand cars because of their financial issues, for that lot of companies founded like Cars24, CarDekho etc.So this dataset is about the prediction of a car price which is used by someone and features for the dataset more like fueltype, mileage, transmission, engine size, mpg, mainly the age of the car means  how many years old that car since buy. So the task is to build the model that can predict the second hand car price based on given attributes.

Suppose, from any company like cars24, OLX, or cardekho.com gives you a dataset and told to build a generalized ML model based on given attributes to predict the price of a car. So basically it is a Regression problem for ML. Now we have to use various algorithms from sklearn library to build a model.

**Conclusion/ Results**
As a result we can say, RandomForest is the best fit to this dataset, gives 99%  accuracy for train set and 93 for test set. XGboost also gave best results with 91%
